# Research-bolt

🔍 Overview
ResearchBolt is a next-generation research platform that revolutionizes how students, developers, and researchers interact with academic articles. It goes beyond just finding papers; it helps users understand, build from, and grow through them. Combining intelligent search, learning roadmaps, AI coaching, and automatic toolkits, this platform aims to become the world's most helpful research assistant.

✨ Core Problem
Current platforms like Google Scholar, arXiv, and Semantic Scholar help find research papers but fail to:

Guide users from an idea to implementation.

Offer meaningful filters and project starter kits.

Teach necessary skills to understand complex topics.

Provide real-time, conversational research support.

✨ Unique Solution (Key Features)
🔮 Reverse Search Engine (Problem → Papers)
Users describe their problem or idea in plain English, and the system uses AI-powered semantic search to find the most relevant papers across multiple databases.

Example: “I want to detect lung disease using CNN” → Finds 10+ related, recent research papers.

💪 Build-from-Paper Toolkit

Extracts datasets, code snippets, used libraries, and creates a ready-to-use GitHub project structure from the paper's methodology.

🌍 Research Skill Roadmaps

Generates learning paths to help users understand a paper, suggesting video lectures, mini-projects, and prerequisite concepts.

🧠 AI Research Thinking Coach

An AI chatbot that trains users to think like researchers by asking them deep, reflective, and constructive questions based on their topic or paper.

🤝 How Does This Help People?
👩‍🎓 A Student
“I want to do a mini project on brain tumor detection using AI. I don’t know what paper to start with or what tools to use.”

Your platform helps:

Describe the idea → get papers.

Learn what skills are needed → follow roadmap.

Build starter code with toolkit.

Get guidance from AI coach.

🎯 Saves 10+ hours of struggling and gives confidence.

👨‍🏫 A Professor
“I want to assign recent, practical papers to students and track their progress.”

Your platform can:

Allow assigning paper bundles.

Track who’s built what.

Encourage reproducibility.

👩‍🔬 A Researcher
“I want to find a paper on using LLMs in bioinformatics that I can replicate and extend.”

Your platform:

Matches their intent.

Shows only reproducible papers.

Offers dataset/code extraction.

🌐 External Integrations
arXiv ✔️ (Free API)

PubMed ✔️ (E-Utilities API)

Semantic Scholar ✔️ (Public API)

PapersWithCode ✔️ (ML Paper-Code Linking)

Springer ✔️ (Open Access API)

Optional Paid APIs: IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, GitHub scraping.

📊 Target Users
Students working on research or mini-projects.

Professors assigning reproducible projects.

Developers looking to replicate state-of-the-art models.

First-time researchers needing guided exploration.

🔧 Tech Stack Suggestions
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS.

Backend: FastAPI or Flask (Python).

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

AI Search: Sentence Transformers / OpenAI Embeddings.

Chatbot: OpenAI API / LangChain.

Search Indexing: Elasticsearch (Optional).

🚀 MVP Plan
Implement reverse search using arXiv and Semantic Scholar.

Add skill roadmap generator via GPT.

Create AI research chatbot.

Design paper-to-toolkit code extractor.

Launch with top 1000 indexed papers.

🔥 Why It Stands Out
Reverse Search – Connects user intent to real research.

Toolkit Builder – Bridges theory and real-world use.

Learning Roadmaps – Personalized, effective upskilling.

AI Research Coach – Builds researcher mindset.

📈 Long-Term Vision
Crowdsourced annotation and discussion threads per paper.

Research-based leaderboard / gamification.

Collaboration tools for small research groups.

Conference and journal recommendation engine.

📅 Next Steps
Finalize feature scope for MVP.

Assign modules to team members.

Setup GitHub repository and branches.

Begin testing data source APIs.
